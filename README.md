# word_ladder - Final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures subject

Co-developed with https://github.com/RGarrido03

Utility that reads a dictionary and builds a word graph. Allows vizualization of word chains: words that differ only in a single character to another.
Calculates and prints the largest connected component diameter as well as the largest word chain. Prints graph and hash table statistics.

The assignment consisted in implementing a graph through the implementation of a hash table. The union-find data structure was also used in order to study the graph's connected components.

The code to read the dictionary, as well as the logic to permutate over UTF-8 word variantions, was written in advance by the subject teachers.
